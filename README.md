Software Engineer

I currently write software in C/C++ for a large Aerospace company.

Working with all varieties of Linux on desktop/rackmount/embedded hardware.

I have recently picked up the retro bug and have reaquired an Atari 8-bit computer (130XE) and a FujiNet 1.6

I plan on uploading the very small amount of software that I have written that can be classified as public domain...
